Bugs & Inconsistencies

When one attempts to go to the Contact designer page when not logged in, it takes you to the log in page, but doing anything else when not logged in takes you to the sign up page. they should be consistent. either they should all be sign up or all be login

When one has an item in the wishlist, and you click the added to wishlist link, it doesn't show up in the wishlist list, and you have to click the wishlist link again for it to show up

Challenges

Some unpleasant looking XPaths are being used to address elements in the page, and I learnt a few new XPath tricks since it can be difficult to address an element without a simple id tag

It's clear that a class needed to be written to encapsulate the operations of interacting with this web page for the sake of the code being DRY and abstracting away repeated code. I forsook that so I could get all the testcases done by the end of the week. I will be creating that class over the weekend and since most likely noone will get a chance to take a look at it this week, I'll most likely resubmit an updated version with that encapsulation present

Same thing goes for data. The data like login information and tags is hard-coded into the testcases
